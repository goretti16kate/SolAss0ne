 Logical Operators
- Define a Solidity contract called LogicalOperators.
- Add two Boolean variables to the contract: a and b, and initialize them to true and false, respectively.
- Write a function called logicalOperations that returns the results of the following logical operations:
a && b
a || b
!a
